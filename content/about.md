Hi! I'm Sharif :)

My journey with software started when I learned a little bit of C to program my first microcontroller. From there, I got more into MATLAB and using programming to help solve control systems problems and analyze dynamic control systems.

After a while, I found myself in the medical device industry and creating my own version of a LIMS from the ground up.

Since then, I have worked with various technologies & programming languages including Go, Python & TypeScript. Most of my work revolved around containerized and on-prem deployed software with applications ranging from DNA sequencing and tissue sample tracking to Zero Trust networking products.

More recently, I've been exploring clound-native technologies - really tbh just Kubernetes - and trying to develop more expertise on the topic.
