After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll see (and do) what it takes to move this workflow to use kubernetes to manage the containers instead.
This post is partially motivated by docker&amp;rsquo;s recent changes to their licensing model and partially motivated by just wanting to learn more about kubernetes and help close the gap between workloads in production and workloads in development.</description></item></channel></rss>
