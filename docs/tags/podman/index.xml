Adding FileSync Skaffold watches for changes and rebuilds the containers by default. However, completely rebuilding the container can quickly become very impractical.
To get around this, we can use the FileSync to tell Skaffold to copy changes to an already-built container instead of rebuilding the whole thing. For our project from the previous post, this will be fairly simple: adjust your skaffold.</description></item><item><title>Moving a docker-compose workflow to Kubernetes with Skaffold</title><link>/post/2022-01-31-compose-to-skaffold/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2022-01-31-compose-to-skaffold/</guid><description>Introduction and motivation In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through creating a small stub server using Go, and we&amp;rsquo;ll deploy it in a development environment using docker-compose. After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll see (and do) what it takes to move this workflow to use kubernetes to manage the containers instead.
This post is partially motivated by docker&amp;rsquo;s recent changes to their licensing model and partially motivated by just wanting to learn more about kubernetes and help close the gap between workloads in production and workloads in development.</description></item></channel></rss>
